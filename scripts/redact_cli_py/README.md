# Redact CLI

## Overview
The Redaction Tool enables you to remove Personally Identifiable Information (PII) or sensitive information from documents before sharing them with others. The tool will output a redacted image, redacted OCR.json file and redacted labels.json file.

Below is an example of an image before and after redaction.
![image-before-after-redaction](./images/DL-before-after-redaction.png)

The OCR.json and labels.json will also be redacted while keeping the semantics of the texts (e.g. length, upper/lower case, character/digit patterns, etc.)

## Version
Redact CLI 0.2.1

## Setup Environment

Ensure you have the following tools,
- Python 3.9 _or_ pyenv (for automatically installing Python 3.9)
- pipenv

### Linux / MacOS

1. Install `pyenv` for managing Python version.

```
pip install pyenv
```

2. Install `pipenv` for managing Python packages.

```
pip install pipenv
```

3. Install packages denoted in `Pipfile`.
```
cd redact_cli_py/
pipenv install
```

### Windows

1. Install `pyenv-win`. See https://github.com/pyenv-win/pyenv-win#installation

2. Install Python 3.9 manually because `pipenv` has not integrated well with `pyenv-win` yet.

```
pyenv install 3.9.4
pyenv rehash
```

Alternatively you can install Python 3.9 from official build manually and config the python path in `pipenv`.

3. Install `pipenv` for managing Python packages.

```
pip install pipenv
```

4. Install packages denoted in `Pipfile`.
```
cd redact_cli_py/
pipenv install
```


## Run

Take a look at the test data (`testdata/*`) first. These are the files for sanity checks.

### Activate the environment

There are 2 options to enable the correct python environment, both would achieve the same result:

1. run `pipenv shell`. In this way, the following commands in the same shell will run in the activated mode. E.g.,
```
pipenv shell
python redact.py <type> <path1> <path2> <path3>
pytest
```

2. prepend `pipenv run` to every command. E.g.,
```
pipenv run python redact.py <type> <path1> <path2> <path3>
pipenv run pytest
```

### Redact Image

``` bash
python redact.py image <image_path> <fott_label_path> <output_path>
```

### Redact OCR Result

``` bash
python redact.py ocr <ocr_result_path> <fott_label_path> <output_path>
```

### Redact FOTT Label Path

``` bash
python redact.py fott <fott_label_path> <output_path>
```

### Batch Redaction
Batch redaction supports redacting a folder rather than executing on a single file. Both the input and the output supports two sources:
1. local folder: a path to a folder on your local machine.
2. Azure Blob Storage virtual folder: a URL to a Blob Storage container and a folder path to denotes the folder.

``` bash
python batch_redact.py <input_container> <input_folder_path> <output_container> <output_folder_path>
```

#### Container
You can provide one of the two options:
1. `local`: this means you read/write data from local machine.
2. `https://<blob_account_url>/<container_name>?<sas_token>`: this means you read/write data from the the container `container_name` of the Azure blob account `blob_account_url`. Please make sure your `sas_token` grants the correct access (Read/List for input, Read/Add/Create/Write/Delete/List for output).

#### Examples

1. Input from local folder 'raw/' and output to local folder 'redacted/'.
``` bash
python batch_redact.py local raw/ local redacted/
```

2. Download data from a Blob Storage v-folder `deep/folder/` in the container `data` and output to local folder `redacted/`.
``` bash
python batch_redact.py "https://my.blob.account/data?<my_secret_SAS_token>" deep/folder/ local redacted/
```

3. Redact and upload local `raw/` data to v-folder `deep/folder/` in the container `data`.
``` bash
python batch_redact.py local raw/ "https://my.blob.account/data?<my_secret_SAS_token>" deep/folder/
```

4. Get the data from a Blob Storage container `data` and the v-folder `folder1/`, redact it, and upload back to the same container with a different v-folder path `folder2/`.
``` bash
python batch_redact.py "https://my.blob.account/data?<my_secret_SAS_token>" folder1/ "https://my.blob.account/data?<my_secret_SAS_token>" folder2/
```

#### Note

1. Surround the URL with double quotes to prevent wrong character escape in the SAS token.
2. Visit [Create Your SAS tokens with Azure Storage Explorer](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/translator/document-translation/create-sas-tokens?tabs=Containers) to see how to create a SAS token for this program to use.
3. Currently, this redact CLI only support ASCII character redaction (Latin alphabets without the accent marks).

### Test

To run the unit tests, simply run

```
pytest
```

in the root folder.

### Note

1. You can also take a look at the `redact/__init__.py` file. The command line interface (CLI) is just a thin wrapper on `redact_image()`, `redact_ocr_result()`, and `redact_fott_label()`. You could extend the code on top of the three functions for achieving your own goal, such as to redact a batch of data.
2. For batch redaction, we currently only support `.jpeg`, `.jpg`, `.png`, `.tif`, `.tiff`, and `.bmp` as the file extension for images. PDF files are not supported.
